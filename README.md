[Central building]
Central building represent XTJLU
-Base: Through the polygon, the basic framework of the Central Building was created.
-Line: Using the “While” , I expressed the straight lines on the exterior of the Central Building.

[Tree, Flower]
Because there are trees and flowers around the Central Building, put them in a congratulatory card.
Tree:  It's a combination of squares and circles.
Flower: Flowers were drawn through six circles and straight lines.
Flowers of different heights were made through translatef().

[Sky]
To express the sky, the background color is set to be similar to the sky and the sun clouds are drawn on it.
Cloud: In order to represent clouds floating in the sky, movement was embodied in the clouds.
Keyboard and mouse interaction have been added to change the movement.        
I have set the two clouds so that they can start from different positions.
(Keyboard interaction) 
U and u make increase the speed of cloud movement.
D and d make decrease the speed of cloud movement..
Q and q  are button to close the window.
R and r make cloud back to speed of first movement.

(Mouse interaction) 
1.Pressing the left button of the mouse stops the clouds from moving.
2.When the right button of the mouse is pressed, the direction of movement of the cloud changes in the opposite direction.

[15 th] 
Since it is XJTLU 15th anniversary card, numbers and letters meaning the 15th anniversary are made into a square combination.
It is implemented so that letters are not covered even by the movement of clouds.
