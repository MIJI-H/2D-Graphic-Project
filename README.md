[Central building]
<br/>
Central building represent XTJLU
<br/>
-Base: Through the polygon, the basic framework of the Central Building was created.
<br/>
-Line: Using the “While” , I expressed the straight lines on the exterior of the Central Building.
<br/><br/>
[Tree, Flower]
<br/>
Because there are trees and flowers around the Central Building, put them in a congratulatory card.
<br/>
Tree:  It's a combination of squares and circles.
<br/>
Flower: Flowers were drawn through six circles and straight lines.
<br/>
Flowers of different heights were made through translatef().
<br/><br/>
[Sky]
<br/>
To express the sky, the background color is set to be similar to the sky and the sun clouds are drawn on it.<br/>
Cloud: In order to represent clouds floating in the sky, movement was embodied in the clouds.<br/>
Keyboard and mouse interaction have been added to change the movement. <br/>       
I have set the two clouds so that they can start from different positions.<br/><br/>

(Keyboard interaction) 
<br/>
U and u make increase the speed of cloud movement.<br/>
D and d make decrease the speed of cloud movement.<br/>
Q and q  are button to close the window.<br/>
R and r make cloud back to speed of first movement.<br/><br/>

(Mouse interaction) <br/>
1.Pressing the left button of the mouse stops the clouds from moving.<br/>
2.When the right button of the mouse is pressed, the direction of movement of the cloud changes in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>

[15 th] <br/>
Since it is XJTLU 15th anniversary card, numbers and letters meaning the 15th anniversary are made into a square combination.<br/>
It is implemented so that letters are not covered even by the movement of clouds.
